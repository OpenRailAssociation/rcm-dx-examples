# RCM-DX examples

This repositories contains some example script how to interact with RCM-DX
files.

Currently we provide a MATLAB script which allows loading of a RCM-DX file in
MATLAB from a configuration. The script and a configuration template are
provided in [](Matlab/dataImport_Analysis) Please refer to examples section
within the code for more information about how to use this function. 

For more information about the RCM-DX format, please refer to the format
specification available at
